## Extract basal data and convert to agb extent

Biomass field data clean v4.ipynb
Extracts species level basal data from an excel spreadsheet and outputs a data frame called slats_c_bio_site_totals_v(n).csv
The notebook calculates site proportions, STBA, LTBA and DTBA, applies the allometric cofactors from Cook et al. 2005) to calculate Carbon extent then applies the secondary cofactor to convert C extent to AGB extent.

Biomass proportion tern field data clean v1.ipynb
Extracts STBA from the TERN basal_area_data_Grant_SEPT2022.xlsx excel spreadsheet.
The notebook joins location data with STBA proportions and applies the allometric cofactors from Cook et al. 2005) to calculate Carbon extent then applies the secondary cofactor to convert C extent to AGB extent.
